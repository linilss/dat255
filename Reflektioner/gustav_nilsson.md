# Gustav Nilsson - Reflection 
## Week 1
### What do I want to learn or understand better?
I have never used Scrum before, but I have seen it used by others, and I am really excited to learn it myself. It seems really beneficial when it comes to develop things in group, which I have always had a bit trouble with (coordinating the work that is).
### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Whenever we sit together as a group, I try to listen and be observant to if anyone needs help with anything. If it is something I know myself right now, I ask them if they would like me to show them anything, and if it is something I don't know I try to look it up myself first (since I want to learn as well).
### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I try to discuss the best way to split up the work with them the best I can. However, I am still pretty silent in the group, since I just met them. But I am sure it will get better very fast as soon as I get to know the others. 
### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have attended the lectures, to try to learn Scrum the best I can. Outside of that we had some group meetings where we all got together and discussed how we will work. I helped others with Git and creating the reflection-files in the proper format for displaying at GitHub. I also spent some time on my own to improve my Git skills.

My total time spent was
Monday: 13-17 Lecture = 4 hours
Wednesday: 13-17 Lecture = 4 hours
Thursday: 19-21, Git study = 2 hours
Friday: 13-15 Lecture, 15-17 Group Meeting = 4 hours

Total = 14 hours
