# Gustav Nilsson - Reflection 
## Week 1
### What do I want to learn or understand better?
I have never used Scrum before, but I have seen it used by others, and I am really excited to learn it myself. It seems really beneficial when it comes to develop things in group, which I have always had a bit trouble with (coordinating the work that is).
### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Whenever we sit together as a group, I try to listen and be observant to if anyone needs help with anything. If it is something I know myself right now, I ask them if they would like me to show them anything, and if it is something I don't know I try to look it up myself first (since I want to learn as well).
### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I try to discuss the best way to split up the work with them the best I can. However, I am still pretty silent in the group, since I just met them. But I am sure it will get better very fast as soon as I get to know the others. 
### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have attended the lectures, to try to learn Scrum the best I can. Outside of that we had some group meetings where we all got together and discussed how we will work. I helped others with Git and creating the reflection-files in the proper format for displaying at GitHub. I also spent some time on my own to improve my Git skills.  
  
**My total time spent was 14 hours**  
Monday: 13-17 Lecture = 4 hours  
Wednesday: 13-17 Lecture = 4 hours  
Thursday: 19-21, Git study = 2 hours  
Friday: 13-15 Lecture, 15-17 Group Meeting = 4 hours   
  
## Week 2
### What do I want to learn or understand better?
Since working on an Android app will be the focus of the project, I really feel like I would like to understand the process and system in general better. How different view interact, etc, and how the UI in applications are built up. Both of these things are pretty much mysteries to me at this point.
### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I have taken a real deep-dive into Android the best I can, and while some things are still a bit mysterious (the best structure of a big app, and to create good UIs) to me, I think I have gained a lot of knowledge in a very short time. THerefor I will hopefully be able to answer other people's questions regarding Android to an at pretty high degree. I will continue my attempt to becoming the "Android guru" of the team.
### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
The project is still very much in the start-up phase which means we have yet to properly start using Scrum to divide up work. I have attended a meeting where a daily scrum was performed. However, we have all just decided to read up on android, the app we will work on, git and other information until the next sprint, without producing any "actual work".
### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I would like to earn Android very well as early as possible so the challenges later will mostly be due to the actual project requirements, and not how to use a certain system. I think it would be very beneficial for the group if a few of us dives more into the workings of Android and can act as support for the others when it comes to technical questions.  
  
(NOTE: This sprint was only until Wednesday due to spring break, next sprint will be longer than usual)  
  
**My total time spent was 19 hours**  
Saturday: 15-20, Android Studio + tutorials  = 5 hours  
Sunday: 9-14, Android Studio + tutorials = 5 hours  
Monday: 13-15, Lecture = 2 hours  
Tuesday: 18-21, Android Studio + tutorials = 3 hours  
Wednesday: 13-15, Lecture = 2 hours  
           15-17, Group Meeting = 2 hours  
  
## Week 3
### What do I want to learn or understand better?
For the future, I would like to understand React Native better, and how the PortableCDM-app works.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

By focusing on becoming an expert on React Native, I hope to be able to help everyone that has questions or does not understand the workings of the app. I will also try to share any tutorials I come across which I find good, so others can try to learn themselves as well.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I have attended the weekly scrum meeting, where we discussed and wrote our group reflection, as well as planned the next sprint.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have the past weeks spent a lot of time understanding Android development, which turned out to be a mistake. I had missed that the app used React Native and was not natively written for android (I had assumed this was the case due to the android tutorial provided on the course page). THerefor I have studied a lot more about android studio and android than needed for this project.
So, for the second part of this sprint I have battled with trying to get the PortableCDM-app and Expo to work instead. I eventually succeeded, after lots of error and issues. I can now login to the service with the credentials provided in the emulator.

I succeeded in completing both tasks in the sprint, getting the app to work, and change a small element in it (I changed the text in a couple of places)
Unfortunately I missed the first handledartillfälle due to a job interview, but I feel like I have gotten up to date about what was said.  
  
NOTE: This sprint was much longer than usual our change to ending on Wednesdays, making it 1,5 weeks.  
NOTE: I also worked during the easter holiday with my goal, which is why I report the time for 2.5 weeks here.

    8-12, Android Studio + tutorials = 4 hours  
    13-17,  Android Studio + tutorials = 4 hours

## Week 4
### What do I want to learn or understand better?
I still have a hard time grasping the overall functionality of the PortableCDM-app, where things happen, where and how data is stored and such. I need to take a deepdive and try to understand the application at its core to be able to work with it, and make changes to it, more efficiently.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Since I have successfully made changes to the app now that actually work, I believe I can help others at least somewhat in doing the same, with tips on where some things are and how some things work. Whenever questions are asked I do my best to try and answer them.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
Unfortunately I missed the weekly scrum where the group reflection was written due to people coming to fix a water leakage in my appartment. Since I missed that, I also missed the beginning of the sprint. However, I have signed up for a task (K8) in the sprint backlog, as well as attended at any other meetings with the group.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
My task for this sprint was to set up the default favorite states in the app to match the one that needed according to the states collected by Fredrik (which consisted of both those in the minimum required states documents, as well as the ones requested by the end-user)
I had a bit of trouble doing this since I do not understand the code of the app very well, but after some trial and error I succesfully located the place where they are set when the app is started for the first time, as well as filled in the required states as defaults.

**My total time spent was 10 hours**  
Thursday:  
    16-17, Reflection + planning = 1 hour  
Friday:
	13-17, Working with Git and Expo + Task K1 = 4 hours
Sunday:
	10-12, Working on Task K1 = 2 hours
Monday:
    13-16, Working on Task K1 = 3 hours
