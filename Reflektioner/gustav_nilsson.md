# Gustav Nilsson - Reflection 
## Week 1
### What do I want to learn or understand better?
I have never used Scrum before, but I have seen it used by others, and I am really excited to learn it myself. It seems really beneficial when it comes to develop things in group, which I have always had a bit trouble with (coordinating the work that is).
### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Whenever we sit together as a group, I try to listen and be observant to if anyone needs help with anything. If it is something I know myself right now, I ask them if they would like me to show them anything, and if it is something I don't know I try to look it up myself first (since I want to learn as well).
### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I try to discuss the best way to split up the work with them the best I can. However, I am still pretty silent in the group, since I just met them. But I am sure it will get better very fast as soon as I get to know the others. 
### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have attended the lectures, to try to learn Scrum the best I can. Outside of that we had some group meetings where we all got together and discussed how we will work. I helped others with Git and creating the reflection-files in the proper format for displaying at GitHub. I also spent some time on my own to improve my Git skills.

My total time spent was
Monday: 13-17 Lecture = 4 hours
Wednesday: 13-17 Lecture = 4 hours
Thursday: 19-21, Git study = 2 hours
Friday: 13-15 Lecture, 15-17 Group Meeting = 4 hours

Total = 14 hours

## Week 2
### What do I want to learn or understand better?
Since working on an Android app will be the focus of the project, I really feel like I would like to understand the process and system in general better. How different view interact, etc, and how the UI in applications are built up. Both of these things are pretty much mysteries to me at this point.
### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I have taken a real deep-dive into Android the best I can, and while some things are still a bit mysterious (the best structure of a big app, and to create good UIs) to me, I think I have gained a lot of knowledge in a very short time. THerefor I will hopefully be able to answer other people's questions regarding Android to an at pretty high degree. I will continue my attempt to becoming the "Android guru" of the team.
### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
The project is still very much in the start-up phase which means we have yet to properly start using Scrum to divide up work. I have attended a meeting where a daily scrum was performed. However, we have all just decided to read up on android, the app we will work on, git and other information until the next sprint, without producing any "actual work".
### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I would like to earn Android very well as early as possible so the challenges later will mostly be due to the actual project requirements, and not how to use a certain system. I think it would be very beneficial for the group if a few of us dives more into the workings of Android and can act as support for the others when it comes to technical questions.

(NOTE: This sprint was only until Wednesday due to spring break, next sprint will be longer than usual)
My total time spent was
Saturday: 15-20, Android Studio + tutorials  = 5 hours
Sunday: 9-14, Android Studio + tutorials = 5 hours
Monday: 13-15, Lecture = 2 hours
Tuesday: 18-21, Android Studio + tutorials = 3 hours
Wednesday: 13-15, Lecture = 2 hours
           15-17, Group Meeting = 2 hours
Total = 19 hours
