**Week 1**

**What do I want to learn or understand better?**
I have no prior knowledge of working in Git or scrum and have spent approximately 8h trying to get the basics to be able to proceed efficiently. I have also attended all the lectures.  I have been helped by other team members with better knowledge, wich has been very helpful. I plan to spend more time during the weekend to learn Git, Trello, scrum theory and using the command line. By trying to learn quickly I hope to be able to focus on the actual coding and delivering value to the project during the coming weeks.



**How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**
I have set up an extra repository with some other course participants to be able to experiment outside the "real" code. I share my knowledge with friends who are in the same position, that is, complete beginners to Git and scrum. I believe this is helpful in the beginning since we can probably learn a lot from eachother. 


**What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**
Since it is the first week we have barely begun our scrum practises. I have participated in shaping our plan for daily scrum meetings and created a scrum board in Trello. 


**What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).**
As previously mentioned my main learning objective for the first (maybe also second, depending on result) week is to learn the new methods of Git and scrum. I want to feel confident in working in the new environments and efficiently handle the situations that can appear. I plan to learn by watching Youtube tutorials, Git videos and learn from other team members. I believe it is important to understand the practise early on to be able to focus on coding and team work later in the projcet. By having a good understanding I will be a better team member. 


**Time spent on course**
lectures: 8 h
group meetings: 2 h
git tutorials & learning scrum: 8 h
total: 18 h 


**Week 2**

**What do I want to learn or understand better?**
I am still in the beginning of underastandind android studio and getting back into coding. I would like to learn how to use Android studio in an effortless way to be able to focus on the code. This is something I am currently working on by watching tutorials and trying to figure out how to use the different functions. 
**How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**
I try to help classmates or groupmembers when my knowledge is sufficient. For example some of my group mates are also beginners to android studio and we try to share our knowledge to learn faster. When it comes to helping the entire group I try to be attentive during our daily scrum meetings to identify if anyone needs help. If I can't help them myself I try to find a person that can help them. I will share tutorials etc. if i find that they would be useful to other group members. 
**What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**
I have participated in the scrum meetings and contributed to the scrum board wih new potential user stories. We are currently preparing for meeting the product owner and that is part of it. For the next week I will be scrummaster and I have already set a time for our meeting and informed the group of the location. I have also connected the group calendar to our slack to simplify planning. 

**What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).**
Last week my ambition was to learn more about git and scrum wich i did successfully. I now understand the basic concepts of both. I learnt most from watching tutorials on youtube, read course material and ask group members for advice. This was a successful way of learning for me. For the next week I will shift my focus to learning Android Studio. This since the next sprint will be the start of coding , and I want to be prepared. My ambition is to have completed the Android1 example in Extras at the course page. I wish to complete at least one more simple application example to gain additional experience. 

**Time spent on course**
lectures: 4 h
group meetings: 2 h
git tutorials & learning scrum: 4 h
total: 10 h 
Please note that this sprint consisted of only 3 days.


**Week 3**

**What do I want to learn or understand better?**
Now that I can build and run the app I want to focus my learning toward understanding what delivers value to the end user. currently I have read some of the descriptions of the port procedure, but i need to understand it better to be able to deliver solutions to the end user. I also want to continue to improve my skills in android studio and scrum methodology. Since last week focus has been to solve errors that surfaced during the build phase which has taught me a lot about working in android studio and to solve errors. 

**How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**
Me and other members of the team plan to sit down together to work on task breakdown and understand how to work on our user stories tomorrow. By doing this i think the entire team can get a better understanding of the project and its scope. As mentioned during the previous week I will share tutorials I find useful and try to help team members that need advice. I plan to search for more tutorials during this sprint to accelerate my knowledge. By doing this I hope to further develop my own skills, while sharing knowledge with my team.  

**What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**
I have participated in the daily scrum meetings and been attentive to the scrumboard. Unfortunately this week I was only able to attend one of the metings in person, but I participated via skype for one of the others and read the notes from the third meeting. For this next sprint i will have the possibility to attend all meetings, sonething I think will improve my contribution to the group. 

**What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).**
Last week my ambition was to learn Android studio better and that has been partly successful. Unfortunately since there was a lot of trouble to build the code in AS i did not get as much time to work with the actual code as I wanted to. For that reason I will continue to try to learn android studio better. By the end of the sprint I eventually managed to build and run the code, and also make minor changes, which was the sprint backlog for the team this sprint, although i wish i could have spent more time doing the changes rather than googling error messages. An addition to my learning objectiveis to understand the existing code better to be able to make the changes we aspire to do in the sprint. This will require an effort from my side, something I look forward to do. 

**Time spent on course**
lectures: 2 h
group meetings: 3 h
Trying to build code in AS: 8 h
total: 13 h 

**Week 4**

**What do I want to learn or understand better?**
For this sprint my aim was to understand what delivered value to the customer. I think I succeeded in this by carefully reading the app description, talking to the end user and discussing with my team. 
For the next sprint my focus will still be partly the same. In addition I will try to understand the structure of the existing application better by reading and trying to understand the code. I will try to do this by learning from my team members, the app description and by navigating the code in atom. Just like last week, I want to continue to improve my skills in android studio and scrum methodology. This by being scrum master and trying to apply scrum in the best sense possible. Android studio, git and version control will be a natural part of the future work of the group, and my experience in these areas will continue to grow. 

**How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**
Last sprint me and other members of the team sat down together to work on task breakdown and tried to understand how to work on our user stories. By doing this i think we all got a better understanding of the project and its scope. I have also tried to be helpful in the work with version control. By trying to learn new skills in the area I hope to further develop my own skills, while sharing knowledge with my team. Other than that I try to share information with the team in our slack chat and stay attentive to the discussion going on in there.  

**What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**
I have participated in all the daily scrum meetings of the sprint. I have also developed the user stories and shaped a "scrum-guide" for the trello board together with Linus. The guide enables a standardised way of writing user stories and tasks for the sprint backlog, to make the team work easier. Other than that the group performed a retrospective with the end user and a review with the team to summarise the sprint. I have been scrum master this sprint and participated in the scrum of scrums.

My learning objectives for the sprint was to understand the existing code better and to be able to make the changes we aspired to do. I believe I achieved this by getting to work with smaller changes in the code, as well as reading the app manual more carefully. I still need to understand the structure of the existing code better to be able to make larger changes to the code, something I hope to achieve this week with some help from my team members. The reason I need a better understanding is to be able to implement larger tasks, such as adding an ETA view in the menu.

**Week 5**

**What do I want to learn or understand better?**
As mentioned last week my ambition is to understand what delivers value to the customer in terms of functionality, combined with trying to understand the structure of the code better. Continued discussions within the team increased my knowledge of what was valueable to the user, and my understanding has grown within the area. Concerning the functionality and structure of the code, my knowledge has improved much. By working on a difficult task with a team member I understood much more than before. Unfortunately, we still didn't manage to solve the entire task this sprint and the work to develop a ETA-view will continue. Just like last week, I want to continue to improve my skills in android studio and scrum methodology. This by being scrum master and trying to apply scrum in the best sense possible. Android studio, git and version control will be a natural part of the future work of the group, and my experience in these areas will continue to grow. 


**How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**
By coding in teams or pairs the work has been more collaborative. We learn from eachother and share experiences wich I find very positive. Each of the team members must understand the task to be able to work on it, wich has sinificantly improved our understanding. I have also tried to be helpful in the work with version control. By trying to learn new skills in the area I hope to further develop my own skills, while sharing knowledge with my team. Other than that I try to share information with the team in our slack chat and stay attentive to the discussion going on there.  

**What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**
Just like last sprint I have participated in all the daily scrum meetings of the sprint. I have also worked according to the "scrum-guide" for the trello board in order to stay true to the scrum methodology. The guide enables a standardised way of writing user stories and tasks for the sprint backlog, to make the team work easier. Other than that the group performed a review with the team to summarise the sprint. I have been scrum master this sprint and participated in the scrum of scrums where I got to take part of other groups experiences.

My learning objectives for the sprint was to understand the existing code better and to be able to make the changes we aspired to do. I believe I achieved this by working with Gustav. Unfortunately we didn't manage to finish our task for this sprint, party due to holidays making coordination difficult, but also because the task was underestimated. We still need to understand the structure of the existing code better to be able to make larger changes to the code, something we hope to achieve this week with some help from the other team members.

Please note this sprint was shorter due to holidays

**Week 6**

**What do I want to learn or understand better?**
Just like last week we didn't manage to solve the entire task for the sprint and the work to develop a ETA-view will continue next sprint as well. Therefore my main focus for this sprint will be to try to estimate the tasks in a more accurate matter. I will do this by trying to define smaller tasks and add more time than previously thought. I want to continue to improve my skills in android studio and scrum methodology. This by being the scrum master and trying to apply scrum in the best sense possible. By being the scrum master I will participate in Scrum of Scrums and hopefully learn some tricks to share with my group.  Android studio, git and version control will be a natural part of the future work of the group, and my experience in these areas will continue to grow by coding.


**How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**
By continously coding in teams or pairs the work has been more collaborative. We learn from eachother and share experiences wich I find very positive. Each of the team members must understand the task to be able to work on it, wich has significantly improved our understanding. As my knowledge in version control and the structure of the code has incresed my abilities to help others have increased accordingly. Other than that I try to share information with the team in our slack chat and stay attentive to the discussion going on there. As the scrum master I share the relevant information from the scrum of scrum meetings in order to keep my team informed.   

**What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**
Just like last sprint I have participated in all the daily scrum meetings of the sprint. I have also continuosly worked according to the team developed "scrum-guide" for the trello board in order to stay true to the scrum methodology. The guide enables a standardised way of writing user stories and tasks for the sprint backlog, to make the team work easier. Other than that the group performed a review with the team to summarise the sprint. A short retrospective was also held with both the prduct owner and the end user. I took an active role in these meetings in order to identify what the actors desired and what they thought of the teams deliveries. I have been scrum master this sprint and participated in the scrum of scrums where I got to take part of other groups experiences and share them with my team.

My learning objectives for the sprint was once again to understand the existing code better and to be able to make the changes we aspired to do. I achieved this by working with Gustav, and the rest of the team on understanding the code. Karin and I managed to add a feature that selects all the states related to Traffic_area, which was useful in the ETA view. The view is now nearly finished and my understanding of the code structure has significantly increased.

**Week 7**

**What do I want to learn or understand better?**
This sprint I wanted to learn to estimate the tasks in a better way, in order to complete them within the set time. This was successful, as the group managed to finish all the tasks in the sprint backlog before deadline. I did this by trying to define smaller parts of the tass and added them up to a total estimate. By doing this I was more likely to make a good estimate, that was plausible to achieve. I still want to continue to improve my skills in version control and scrum methodology. This by being the scrum master and trying to apply scrum in the best sense possible. By being the scrum master I will participate in Scrum of Scrums and hopefully learn some tricks to share with my group.  Android studio, git and version control will be a natural part of the future work of the group, and my experience in these areas will continue to grow by coding. I will try to focus on understanding git better by participating when branches are merged to understand the issues that can sutrface during that process. 


**How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**
Just like last sprint, we have coding in teams or pairs, and the work has been more collaborative. We learn from each other and share experiences wich I find very positive. We can all focus on different aspects and then share our knowledge which increases our efficiency. As my knowledge in version control and the structure of the code has incresed, my abilities to help others have increased accordingly. Other than that I try to share information with the team in our slack chat and stay attentive to the discussion going on there. As the scrum master I share the relevant information from the scrum of scrum meetings in order to keep my team informed. I also try to take an active role in the discussions with the end user and product owners to make sure we udnerstand what they desire.    

**What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**
I have been the scrummaster during almost the entire project. This means I coordinate the daily scrum meetings, and arrange the reviews and sometimes retrospectives. Just like last sprint I have participated in all the daily scrum meetings of the sprint. I have also continuosly worked according to the team developed "scrum-guide" for the trello board in order to simplify the team work and benefit from using scrum. The guide enables a standardised way of writing user stories and tasks for the sprint backlog, to make the team work easier. Other than that the group performed a review with the team to summarise the sprint. A short retrospective was also held with both the prduct owner. This week the end user was not available in person, but we have stayed in contact by email. Other than that I participated in the scrum of scrums where I got to take part of other groups experiences and share them with my team.

As described last week my ambition was to understand the structure of the code, and how to use react native in the best way possible. By working in a team with the remainder of the ETA-view we managed to finish the unfinished tasks and complete the view. During the meeting with the end user I managed to identify the desire for a logbook-view containing only "actuals". Some other team members completed this very quickly which I believe will be very valuable to the end user. My learning objective for the final sprint is to learn a good way to demonstrate the features we have implemented and be able to describe the value to the end user and product owner. I will try to do that by working on use cases, scenarios and preparing for the final presentation. 


**Time spent on course**

**Week 8**

**What do I want to learn or understand better?**
For the previous sprint I wanted to learn to estimate tasks better, and to improve my skills in task breakdown. I did that by discussion with team members and I also learned from previous sprints what a reasonable estimate was like. For the final sprint my ambition was to learn how to present the improvements made to the application to make the en user and product owner understand the value of the changes. My main goal, as well as the groups goal, was to get good responses to our version of PortableCDM and to make the different acctors understand why we designed the application in the way we did. In the end our product was well recieved and appriciated. One observer was initially very critical, but by showing the features live, he changed his mind partly and agreed tha most of the modifications imporved the functionality. By having retrospectives with more than one end user we might have avoided the risk that some other user didn't like the changes. That is something I will bring with me to future projects. If possible: use different people to have input on your modifications and features in order to create the most value for all. Throughout the project I have had the ambition to learn version control, scrum, and android studio better. At this last sprint I have certainly made an improvement compared to the first sprint in all the areas. My prior knowledge was nonexistent and now I have a basic understanding for all of it. The team members were a great asset for me to learn better, and to understand the concepts quickly in order to start working on the project. Of course I could have spent even more time trying to learn the concepts better, by watching more tutorials etc. but considering the course time frame I believe I managed quite well.  


**How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**
Throughout the project we have been coding in teams or pairs, and the work has been very collaborative. We learn from each other and share experiences wich I find very positive. We can all focus on different aspects and then share our knowledge which increases our efficiency. As my knowledge in version control and the structure of the code has incresed, my abilities to help others have increased accordingly. Other than that I try to share information with the team in our slack chat and stay attentive to the discussion going on there. As the scrum master I share the relevant information from the scrum of scrum meetings in order to keep my team informed. I also try to take an active role in the discussions with the end user and product owners to make sure we udnerstand what they desire. For the final sprint I also tried to contribute with my knowledge in making presentations and to describe the features in a understandable way for the end users and product owners. By making use cases and a one-slide presentation the group could get a common understanding of how we would promote the different features.     

**What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**
I have been the scrummaster during almost the entire project. This means I have coordinated the daily scrum meetings, and arranged the reviews and sometimes retrospectives. Just like last sprint I have participated in all the daily scrum meetings of the sprint. I have also continuosly tried to work according to the team developed "scrum-guide" for the trello board in order to simplify the team work and benefit from using scrum. The guide enables a standardised way of writing user stories and tasks for the sprint backlog, to make the team work easier. Sometimes the guide has not been followed as the group has agreed on something in a meeting that is not visible in the board. Something I will bring with me is the value of noting these agreements in order to simplyfy work for members who are not present or for future reference. Other than that the group performed a review with the team to summarise the sprint. A summarization of the reviews was also completed during the sprint, where the entire project was evaluated. A final presentation was held with both the product owner and all the end users from portCDM. The main features and changes made in the app were presented and a scenario was completed with the other groups. Also, I prepared charts concerning our KPI-development and a burndown chart to use in the final group reflection. 


**What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen.

My learning objective for the final sprint was to learn a good way to demonstrate the features we have implemented and be able to describe the value to the end user and product owner. I did that by working on use cases, scenarios and preparing for the final presentation together with the other team members. Me and Karin developed use cases and from the use cases I prepared a powerpoint that illustrated the features and described them in oversight. I also practised to present the powerpoint if that would be neccessary, as the time table of the final presentation wasn't set. In the end I got to make a one-slide presentation about the added features, and my preparations turned out to be useful. I also got to demo the application in the emulator for some intereseted viewers and that taught me a lot. For exmple I learnt in which order it was most efficient to present the different features after watching their reactions. To future projects I bring the insight that the presentation is an important tool to visualise what changes have been made, and that preparation is key in order to deliver a coherent and understandable presentation.
