# Gustav Nilsson - Reflection 
## Week 1
### What do I want to learn or understand better?
I have never used Scrum before, but I have seen it used by others, and I am really excited to learn it myself. It seems really beneficial when it comes to develop things in group, which I have always had a bit trouble with (coordinating the work that is).
### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Whenever we sit together as a group, I try to listen and be observant to if anyone needs help with anything. If it is something I know myself right now, I ask them if they would like me to show them anything, and if it is something I don't know I try to look it up myself first (since I want to learn as well).
### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I try to discuss the best way to split up the work with them the best I can. However, I am still pretty silent in the group, since I just met them. But I am sure it will get better very fast as soon as I get to know the others. 
### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have attended the lectures, to try to learn Scrum the best I can. Outside of that we had some group meetings where we all got together and discussed how we will work. I helped others with Git and creating the reflection-files in the proper format for displaying at GitHub. I also spent some time on my own to improve my Git skills.  
  
**My total time spent was 14 hours**  
Monday: 13-17 Lecture = 4 hours  
Wednesday: 13-17 Lecture = 4 hours  
Thursday: 19-21, Git study = 2 hours  
Friday: 13-15 Lecture, 15-17 Group Meeting = 4 hours   
  
## Week 2
### What do I want to learn or understand better?
Since working on an Android app will be the focus of the project, I really feel like I would like to understand the process and system in general better. How different view interact, etc, and how the UI in applications are built up. Both of these things are pretty much mysteries to me at this point.
### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I have taken a real deep-dive into Android the best I can, and while some things are still a bit mysterious (the best structure of a big app, and to create good UIs) to me, I think I have gained a lot of knowledge in a very short time. THerefor I will hopefully be able to answer other people's questions regarding Android to an at pretty high degree. I will continue my attempt to becoming the "Android guru" of the team.
### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
The project is still very much in the start-up phase which means we have yet to properly start using Scrum to divide up work. I have attended a meeting where a daily scrum was performed. However, we have all just decided to read up on android, the app we will work on, git and other information until the next sprint, without producing any "actual work".
### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I would like to earn Android very well as early as possible so the challenges later will mostly be due to the actual project requirements, and not how to use a certain system. I think it would be very beneficial for the group if a few of us dives more into the workings of Android and can act as support for the others when it comes to technical questions.  
  
(NOTE: This sprint was only until Wednesday due to spring break, next sprint will be longer than usual)  
  
**My total time spent was 19 hours**  
Saturday: 15-20, Android Studio + tutorials  = 5 hours  
Sunday: 9-14, Android Studio + tutorials = 5 hours  
Monday: 13-15, Lecture = 2 hours  
Tuesday: 18-21, Android Studio + tutorials = 3 hours  
Wednesday: 13-15, Lecture = 2 hours  
           15-17, Group Meeting = 2 hours  
  
## Week 3
### What do I want to learn or understand better?
For the future, I would like to understand React Native better, and how the PortableCDM-app works.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

By focusing on becoming an expert on React Native, I hope to be able to help everyone that has questions or does not understand the workings of the app. I will also try to share any tutorials I come across which I find good, so others can try to learn themselves as well.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I have attended the weekly scrum meeting, where we discussed and wrote our group reflection, as well as planned the next sprint.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have the past weeks spent a lot of time understanding Android development, which turned out to be a mistake. I had missed that the app used React Native and was not natively written for android (I had assumed this was the case due to the android tutorial provided on the course page). THerefor I have studied a lot more about android studio and android than needed for this project.
So, for the second part of this sprint I have battled with trying to get the PortableCDM-app and Expo to work instead. I eventually succeeded, after lots of error and issues. I can now login to the service with the credentials provided in the emulator.

I succeeded in completing both tasks in the sprint, getting the app to work, and change a small element in it (I changed the text in a couple of places)
Unfortunately I missed the first handledartillfälle due to a job interview, but I feel like I have gotten up to date about what was said.  
  
NOTE: This sprint was much longer than usual our change to ending on Wednesdays, making it 1,5 weeks.  
NOTE: I also worked during the easter holiday with my goal, which is why I report the time for 2.5 weeks here.

    13-16, Meeting = 3 hours
    
## Week 4
### What do I want to learn or understand better?
I still have a hard time grasping the overall functionality of the PortableCDM-app, where things happen, where and how data is stored and such. I need to take a deepdive and try to understand the application at its core to be able to work with it, and make changes to it, more efficiently.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Since I have successfully made changes to the app now that actually work, I believe I can help others at least somewhat in doing the same, with tips on where some things are and how some things work. Whenever questions are asked I do my best to try and answer them.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
Unfortunately I missed the weekly scrum where the group reflection was written due to people coming to fix a water leakage in my appartment. Since I missed that, I also missed the beginning of the sprint. However, I have signed up for a task (K8) in the sprint backlog, as well as attended at any other meetings with the group.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
My task for this sprint was to set up the default favorite states in the app to match the one that needed according to the states collected by Fredrik (which consisted of both those in the minimum required states documents, as well as the ones requested by the end-user)
I had a bit of trouble doing this since I do not understand the code of the app very well, but after some trial and error I succesfully located the place where they are set when the app is started for the first time, as well as filled in the required states as defaults.

**My total time spent was 10 hours**  
Thursday:  
    16-17, Reflection + planning = 1 hour  
Friday:
	13-17, Working with Git and Expo + Task K1 = 4 hours
Sunday:
	10-12, Working on Task K1 = 2 hours
Monday:
    13-16, Working on Task K1 = 3 hours
    
## Week 5
### What do I want to learn or understand better?
As I said earlier, React Native can be a bit difficult to understand. However, even after reading about it, and getting a better understanding about it in general, I still don't really understand the flow of THIS app. So my focus will be to dwelve into the structure of this app. My idea is to take a long talk with the developer of the app and try to get some kind of summary, explanation to how it works. Then I can hopefully share any insights I might have gotten.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I think understanding the app better really can benefit everyone. As stated earlier, I will try to have a conversation with the developer to gain some insight into everything. Having this information allows me to help the others when they have questions reagrding how different things work in the current app.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I participated in the weekly scrum, and I have used the trello board set up to see how everything is going, and knowing what I should be working on. Since I had no task currently assigned (I completed the job I signed up for last week), I joined forces with two others in the group for a rather large card.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
My goal was to finish task K7 (me and my group), which turned out to be easier said than done. The code-base is still pretty cryptic to me, and I am having a hard time grasping how to transform the current timeline (which is relatively close to what we are looking for) to the ETA view that is needed. That is why I will try to get a better understanding of the app, this week. The task was not completed this week, so we will continue on it next sprint and hopefully succeed then.

**My total time spent was 11 hours**  
Thursday
    19-20, Reflection + Planning = 1 hour
Friday
    13-16, Working on Task K7 = 3 hours
Sunday
    14-15, Working on Task K7 = 1 hours
Tuesday
    13-17, Read about react native  = 4h
Wednesday
    15-17, Möte scrum= 2h
    
## Week 6
### What do I want to learn or understand better?
I think my biggest lacking understand currently is in the world of boating in general. I need to read up on how all the different parts interact, and also read up on some of the terms I don't really understand. This will make it much easier for me to really reason about what is being done than it currently is.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Like planned last week, I had a pretty long talk with one of the developers of the app (Johan), where he showed me some things about the structure and the app in general I had not understood. It was very enlightening, although a lot of information came very fast making it hard to pick up everything. Whever someone has questions about actions, props or some of the other concepts I learned about, I will hopefully be able to help them, explaining the concept to them. I think this will be helpful to everyone developing the app as I believe everyone still feels a bit lost in how things are working.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I attended the Scrum-meetings and took part in writing the group reflection. The estimates that I was part of setting up for the particular task I was working on turned out to be quite a bit optimistic this time as well, taking more time than planned. However, most of it was completed at least, compared to last week where we got somewhat stuck and completed very little (in Task K7 that is).

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I had a discussion with the group of how the ETA-view really should look, and we created a sketch displaying the different elements and functionality needed. This made working on it much easier. Now task K7, which was not finished last week, has been practically finished! I sat several hours and worked hard at the list portion of it, and now the ETA-view seems to display the relevant ETAs with easy to read time information (it has not been reviewed yet). However, the "information boxes" that was figured out was needed during the brainstorming session at the top has are not displaying the right info yet.

**My total time spent was 15 hours**  
Thursday
    19-20,  Reflection+Planning = 1 h
Friday
    13-15, Working on Task K7 = 2h
Saturday
    9-11, Studying app code = 2h
Tuesday
    8-15, Jobba på K7 = 7h
Wednesday
    13-16, Möte + scrum = 3h

    
## Week 7
### What do I want to learn or understand better?
Since I have had troubles with the development again, I would like to understand Expo better. What is actually happening and why when things are not connecting or loading. The documentation is not great, but I do hope that a greater understanding can be reached, and also to avoid a lot of the troubles that we often have.

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Everyone has trouble with the development environment from time to time, so any gained knowledge in how things are working will be of benefit to everyone.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
In the weekly scrum-meeting I took the initiative to split up the rest of the work of K7 into two new cards. The task had been too large from the beginning, making an entire view as a single task. Now each of the two boxes left in the view is its own card, which I and two more group members took on to do this sprint.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
When Task K7 was reviewed, I got feedback that a plus buttom was missing. So with some trouble I added one (however not in the optimal location as I failed to do so), completing K7.
I had troubles with my development environment again. It stopped working and I could not get it to work. This led to me having to sit next to someone in my group doing the programming, which worked well but prohibited me from working at home or outside of my group. Eventually, the day before the ending of the sprint I got it working again. However, not being able to work alone, plus the pressure of finishing the bachelor thesis report this week lead me and my group into not completing both of the assigned cards. 

Note: This week was the deadline for the bachelor thesis and therefor less time than usual was spent (which was also accepted by the group beforehand).

**My total time spent was 11 hours**

## Week 8
### What do I want to learn or understand better?

The last sprint has now been finished and I feel like we reached a good result in the end. I am pleased with how everything turned out, and I think this  was a very good introduction to Scrum.
Overall, I think this course has been very educational in working with groups in a real software project. It was fun produce a final result together, and to show the app during the demonstration to different people. Several of them looked at what we had made and they gave some good feedback. It was also interesting to meet the captain who declared that no one would ever use an app for something like this, which clearly demonstrated the strong resistance that exists against digitalization. This is something that we who go to school at Chalmers seldom actually get to see in real life, but it is a very real problem and something one has to keep in mind when coming up with new solutions to old problems. 

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I did my best during this project to read up on different things and tell other people about my findings when my knowledge could help. However, the knowledge could be shared even better by setting up some sort of system for collecting our knowledge in one place, where people could both read an contribute. As it was now, a lot of knowledge was kept personal even with the best of intentions, especially whenever an individual missed a meeting of any kind. Linus almost started this with his Git-guide, but it was unfortunately not expanded on further. I will try to remember this for future group projects.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?

To summarize, I have participated in all the Scrum meetings we had with few exceptions, and made sure I had some task assigned to me so I had something to work on. The work with Scrum has been far from flawless though, which might be expected from a first try. I am 100% confident that I would do much it better the second time, especially creating the tasks, making them a smaller size with a clear goal that can be performed in a sitting. I think they were the biggest problem during this project, as they encompassed too much and made everyone unsure of what they were actually supposed to do. The exercise we had in the beginning of the course where we got the task of breaking down a project in as many tasks as possible was informative, but the knowledge gained was never really applied in the project. The way of thinking that the more tasks the better, as they get clearer and simples, is definitely something I will keep with me for the future.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I was part of making some of the final changes to the application before the presentation. Nothing major was made this week, but more of a refinement and making sure all parts of the changed app fit together well before the demonstration, which we succeeded in. I also participated in writing the final group reflection as a group.

Note: Me and my team members had misunderstood in that there would be no individual reflection for the last week. Therefore I haven't kept a detailed timelog like previous weeks. Instead this is an estimation from memory.

**My total time spent was 15 hours**
Working with the group: 6h
Working on the project: 5h
Presentation time: 3h
Reflection: 1h
