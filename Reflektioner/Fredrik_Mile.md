# Fredrik Mile  - Reflection
## Week 1
### What do I want to learn or understand better?
Before the start of this course, I had only heard about Scrum but never used it. Scrum seems interesting and something I really want to learn to work with. It is a total different way to work compared to what I'm used to and therefore it is a bit scary but I'm looking forward to learn about it. Unlike Scrum, I had experience with Github before the start of this course and I feel comfortable with it. It will be interesting to see how Github works with a group this big since my earlier groups were of size 4-5 students.I'm looking forward to work more with Github since repetition is always good and it is such as important and good tool to know. 
### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I think that it is important to always be open to help and available as much as possible. I feel comfortable in programming in general and therefore I feel like I can help someone in the team with less experience in programming if they need any help. This could be done by pair programming to get everyone something to stand on. If someone has a problem with Github I will try to help directly if I know how to or help find a solution to the problem.
### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I have attended meetings where we planned and discussed Scrum and also looked into Scrum in general on my own to get more knowledge about it so that I can contribute more in the future.  
### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have looked into Scrum on my own beyond the lectures to get more knowledge about it so I can feel a bit more comfortable. During this course I want to learn some new technologies (programming language/IDE's) depending on the actual project e.g. Andriod Studio (Andriod programming). My main learning objective is to get more comfortable in working with teams this big by using Scrum for other project in the future. By always being open to learn new things and by putting down work I feel like I can be a good team member.  

**Time spent:** Lectures & exercises: 8h, learning Scrum by watching tutorials on youtube: 2h , group meetings 3h

**Total: 13h**

## Week 2
### What do I want to learn or understand better?
I have started to work with Andriod Studio and I want to learn a lot more about it (andriod development in general). I think I understand the main concepts of Scrum now and I'm looking forward to actually use it properly the next week/sprint. We have gained access to the source code of the existing app and I want to learn how to read documentations and code in a good and structured way.
### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I almost always prefer to use video-tutorials instead of written tutorials when I'm a total beginner at something, if I find any good tutorials I will inform my team members that I found a great guide and share it to them as well.  
I had some technical issues when downloading and installing the Andriod Studio so if anyone in the group has any problems with the software, I'm happy to help. 
### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I have participated in Scrum meetings and helped out with the creation of our first user-stories. I also specified myself as the contact person in the group. 
### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
During the last week I gathered more knowledge in Andrio Studio and Andriod Development. I have also participated in scrum meetings and discussions about how we want to use Git. Since we have access to the source code of the app now, I will search for guidelines online to learn about how to read documentations and code that I've now written myself.  

**Time spent:** Lectures & exercises: 4h, Andriod Studio tutorial: 1.5h , group meetings 2h

**Total:7.5h**


## Week 3
### What do I want to learn or understand better?
During this week,I have understood that we are going to develop in react native and not Andriod directly. I have no experience in react native or even JavaScript so I'm looking forward to start learning about them. I also would  like to get a better understanding about how to split a userstorie into tasks and then do an estimation on them. With some discussion with the team I think that I will get a better understanding about how to estimate the tasks and user stories. 
### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I have installed all the components needed to get the development environment to work. I can build and run the app! I have also made small modifications to the app to make sure that everything works. If anyone on the team or even on the other teams has a problem with getting the development environment  to work , I will do my best to help them (preferable if they are using windows).
### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I have participated in Scrum meetings and daily scrums. I was active while discussing the upcoming sprints userstories/tasks and I came with input to the teams reflection. We had a meeting with the product owner and the end-user to be able to get a better understanding about what features they want to have implemented the application.  
### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
The development environment  works for me and I'm ready to start develop. I will continue to read the documentation and look at the source code to get more understanding about how the app is written. I will get started with JavaScript/ReactNative by following video tutorials. 


**Time spent:** Lectures & exercises: 2h , Setting up the development enviorment: 10h , group meetings 6h
**Total: 18h**


## Week 4
### What do I want to learn or understand better?

During this sprint I have started with some react native development and I will continue with that and learn by trying. I'm facing some difficulties with git, I have never used git in this "correct" and advanced way and I feel a bit lost sometimes, when facing the difficulties I will ask my team members for help. 

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I really like to discuss different ways to find and reach a solution, by inviting to discussions I feel that I can help my team to reach our common goals. I have experience in programming in general and if someone needs help to solve a programming-oriented issue I'm going to try my best to help them out.  

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I have participated in Scrum meetings and daily scrums. I was active while discussing the upcoming sprints userstories/tasks and I came with input to the teams reflection. I have been the contact person between us in the group and the end user. I have come up with ideas and reflections with the end-user so that we in the team has gotten a clear idea about what to do.   

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

During this sprint I have sorted out the most useful statements for the "Vessel" in the big states catalog. The useful statements is now shown as default favorites for a Captain. I have also reviewed some tasks done by my team members. During the next sprint I would like to do some more actual coding. 

**Time spent:** Lectures & exercises: 2 , Finding the most useful statments: 2 , group meetings 8h ,discussions and helping: 4h 
**Total: 16h**

## Week 5
### What do I want to learn or understand better?

During the sprint, two days were lost due to Valborg and May 1th which resulted in a few unfinished tasks since we didn't plan the sprint good enough. This could have been avoided by acknowledging the fact that we knew that the two days would be lost. To the coming sprint I would like to plan the sprint better, the number of tasks should and the size of the tasks shouldn't be too big. I want to learn how to form the sprintbacklog, according to the actual available time window. This will be through a more accurate time review and understanding lasts sprints issues. 

### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I really like to discuss different ways to find and reach a solution, by inviting to discussions I feel that I can help my team to reach our common goals. I have experience in programming in general and if someone needs help to solve a programming-oriented issue I'm going to try my best to help them out. 

The main technical problem we are facing is to understand how to reuse the existing code in a way we are pleased with. This means that we need to understand the code and I can see myself helping my team members with that. I found it easier to understand code by discussing it.

### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I have participated in Scrum meetings and daily scrums. I was active while discussing the upcoming sprints userstories/tasks and I came with input to the teams reflection. I have been the contact person between us in the group and the end user. I have come up with ideas and reflections with the end-user so that we in the team has gotten a clear idea about what to do.   

### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

During this sprint I have taken back a feature that we removed during previous sprint, it turned out that the end-user wanted that feature after all. Beyond reviewing tasks I helped with displaying a vessel's destination port instead of its name. During the coming sprint I will contribute to the development of the new ETA-view that we started with this sprint. 

**Time spent:** Tutorial: 2 , Recovery removed feature:  3 , group meetings 4h ,discussions and helping: 2h 
**Total: 11h**
