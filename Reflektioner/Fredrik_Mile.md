# Fredrik Mile  - Reflection
## Week 1
### What do I want to learn or understand better?
Before the start of this course, I had only heard about Scrum but never used it. Scrum seems interesting and something I really want to learn to work with. It is a total different way to work compared to what I'm used to and therefore it is a bit scary but I'm looking forward to learn about it. Unlike Scrum, I had experience with Github before the start of this course and I feel comfortable with it. It will be interesting to see how Github works with a group this big since my earlier groups were of size 4-5 students.I'm looking forward to work more with Github since repetition is always good and it is such as important and good tool to know. 
### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I think that it is important to always be open to help and available as much as possible. I feel comfortable in programming in general and therefore I feel like I can help someone in the team with less experience in programming if they need any help. This could be done by pair programming to get everyone something to stand on. If someone has a problem with Github I will try to help directly if I know how to or help find a solution to the problem.
### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I have attended meetings where we planned and discussed Scrum and also looked into Scrum in general on my own to get more knowledge about it so that I can contribute more in the future.  
### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have looked into Scrum on my own beyond the lectures to get more knowledge about it so I can feel a bit more comfortable. During this course I want to learn some new technologies (programming language/IDE's) depending on the actual project e.g. Andriod Studio (Andriod programming). My main learning objective is to get more comfortable in working with teams this big by using Scrum for other project in the future. By always being open to learn new things and by putting down work I feel like I can be a good team member.  

**Time spent:** Lectures & exercises: 8h, learning Scrum by watching tutorials on youtube: 2h , group meetings 3h

**Total: 13h**

## Week 2
### What do I want to learn or understand better?
I have started to work with Andriod Studio and I want to learn a lot more about it (andriod development in general). I think I understand the main concepts of Scrum now and I'm looking forward to actually use it properly the next week/sprint. We have gained access to the source code of the existing app and I want to learn how to read documentations and code in a good and structured way.
### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I almost always prefer to use video-tutorials instead of written tutorials when I'm a total beginner at something, if I find any good tutorials I will inform my team members that I found a great guide and share it to them as well.  
I had some technical issues when downloading and installing the Andriod Studio so if anyone in the group has any problems with the software, I'm happy to help. 
### What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
I have participated in Scrum meetings and helped out with the creation of our first user-stories. I also specified myself as the contact person in the group. 
### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
During the last week I gathered more knowledge in Andrio Studio and Andriod Development. I have also participated in scrum meetings and discussions about how we want to use Git. Since we have access to the source code of the app now, I will search for guidelines online to learn about how to read documentations and code that I've now written myself.  

**Time spent:** Lectures & exercises: 4h, Andriod Studio tutorial: 1.5h , group meetings 2h

**Total:7.5h**
