**Week 1**

**What do I want to learn or understand better?**
I have no prior knowledge of working in Git or scrum and have spent approximately 8h trying to get the basics to be able to proceed efficiently. I have also attended all the lectures.  I have been helped by other team members with better knowledge, wich has been very helpful. I plan to spend more time during the weekend to learn Git, Trello, scrum theory and using the command line. By trying to learn quickly I hope to be able to focus on the actual coding and delivering value to the project during the coming weeks.



**How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**
I have set up an extra repository with some other course participants to be able to experiment outside the "real" code. I share my knowledge with friends who are in the same position, that is, complete beginners to Git and scrum. I believe this is helpful in the beginning since we can probably learn a lot from eachother. 


**What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**
Since it is the first week we have barely begun our scrum practises. I have participated in shaping our plan for daily scrum meetings and created a scrum board in Trello. 


**What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).**
As previously mentioned my main learning objective for the first (maybe also second, depending on result) week is to learn the new methods of Git and scrum. I want to feel confident in working in the new environments and efficiently handle the situations that can appear. I plan to learn by watching Youtube tutorials, Git videos and learn from other team members. I believe it is important to understand the practise early on to be able to focus on coding and team work later in the projcet. By having a good understanding I will be a better team member. 


**Time spent on course**
lectures: 8 h
group meetings: 2 h
git tutorials & learning scrum: 8 h
total: 18 h 


**Week 2**

**What do I want to learn or understand better?**
I am still in the beginning of underastandind android studio and getting back into coding. I would like to learn how to use Android studio in an effortless way to be able to focus on the code. This is something I am currently working on by watching tutorials and trying to figure out how to use the different functions. 
**How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**
I try to help classmates or groupmembers when my knowledge is sufficient. For example some of my group mates are also beginners to android studio and we try to share our knowledge to learn faster. When it comes to helping the entire group I try to be attentive during our daily scrum meetings to identify if anyone needs help. If I can't help them myself I try to find a person that can help them. I will share tutorials etc. if i find that they would be useful to other group members. 
**What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**
I have participated in the scrum meetings and contributed to the scrum board wih new potential user stories. We are currently preparing for meeting the product owner and that is part of it. For the next week I will be scrummaster and I have already set a time for our meeting and informed the group of the location. I have also connected the group calendar to our slack to simplify planning.

Last week my ambition was to learn more about git and scrum wich i did successfully. I now understand the basic concepts of both. I learnt most from watching tutorials on youtube, read course material and ask group members for advice. This was a successful way of learning for me. For the next week I will shift my focus to learning Android Studio. This since the next sprint will be the start of coding , and I want to be prepared. My ambition is to have completed the Android1 example in Extras at the course page. I wish to complete at least one more simple application example to gain additional experience. 

**Time spent on course**
lectures: 4 h
group meetings: 2 h
git tutorials & learning scrum: 4 h
total: 10 h 
Please note that this sprint consisted of only 3 days.
