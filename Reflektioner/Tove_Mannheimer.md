**Week 1
**What do I want to learn or understand better?**
I have no prior knowledge of working in Git or scrum and have spent approximately 8h trying to get the basics to be able to proceed efficiently. I have also attended all the lectures.  I have been helped by other team members with better knowledge, wich has been very helpful. I plan to spend more time during the weekend to learn Git, Trello, scrum theory and using the command line. By trying to learn quickly I hope to be able to focus on the actual coding and delivering value to the project during the coming weeks.



**How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**
I have set up an extra repository with some other course participants to be able to experiment outside the "real" code. I share my knowledge with friends who are in the same position, that is, complete beginners to Git and scrum. I believe this is helpful in the beginning since we can probably learn a lot from eachother. 


**What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**
Since it is the first week we have barely begun our scrum practises. I have participated in shaping our plan for daily scrum meetings and created a scrum board in Trello. 


**What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).**
As previously mentioned my main learning objective for the first (maybe also second, depending on result) week is to learn the new methods of Git and scrum. I want to feel confident in working in the new environments and efficiently handle the situations that can appear. I plan to learn by watching Youtube tutorials, Git videos and learn from other team members. I believe it is important to understand the practise early on to be able to focus on coding and team work later in the projcet. By having a good understanding I will be a better team member.
