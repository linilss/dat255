**What do I want to learn or understand better?** 

This week we have been introduced to new tools, Git and Scrum. Since both of them are new to me I want to learn how to practice them both. I find scrum specially interesting since it seems in general to be a very useful tool for various projects. The Lego exercise was a very good exemplification how to use scrum, it helped a lot in understanding the tool. I have started to go through the course material that is stated in the coursePM and I have started looking at Git tutorials. 

**How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**

Since most of the material that have been introduced this week is new to me my main focus has been me learning the tools, and still doing. I can help the group by being available in our slack channel, help organize and setting us up as a group and try as good as possible with limited knowledge in scrum and Git. 

**What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**

The project has not been started which is the same for the application of scrum. We have had a meeting where channels were configured and a project in Github has been started which is where we will practice our Scrum board. In general my contribution towards the teams application could be participating in the Lego exercise, where we had our first practice of how we work as a group with scrum. 

**What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?**

That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies,concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).

As the first question my learning objectives this week and probably next one is to be more comfortable and learn the new tools, Git and scrum. I believe that a great knowledge about the tools will make it possible to contribute more to the teams deliveries. My personal goal is that when finishing this course I want to be able to apply introduced tools such as scrum to various projects and have a greater understanding how software projects are made. How I will accomplish these goals is to learn from our course literature, various tutorials, our team and our own work and by experimenting with the tools on my own. 

**Time spent:** Lectures & exercises: 8h, tutorials: 2h , group meetings 3h **Total: 13h**

**What do I want to learn or understand better?** 

Beyond learning more about Git and Scrum I want to learn how to use the development software Android studios and gaining more insight in the task that we are assigned to do.

**How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**

Like other week my main focus is me learning the introduced tools. I can help the group by being available in our slack channel, help organize and setting us up as a group and try as good as possible with limited knowledge in scrum,Git and android studios. 

**What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**

We have now been introduced to the project and we have started by doing some User stories, I have contibruted with discussing what could be relevant and useful in the User stories, doing our stories that is in progress and organizing a kickoff with the projectgroup that is now in progress.

**What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?**

That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies,concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).

I have gained more experience in how to apply Scrum, Git and Android Studios. Achieved by participating in daily Scrum meetings and working with our Scrum board, getting more familiar with Git through tutorials and literature and by doing this weeks exercise, building an application in Android studios. Next week I want to learn more about the tools Scrum, Git, Android studios and the task of our project. I will make it happen by study course literature, watch tutorials, learn from other team members and study given material about the project.  

**Time spent:** Lectures & exercises: 4h, tutorials: 1h , group meetings 4h **Total: 9h**
