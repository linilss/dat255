**What do I want to learn or understand better?** 

In the beginning of this week I had never worked in Git or with the Scrum methodology. During the week, the subjects have been introduced in class and we’ve been discussing it in the project team. I want to learn about Git and how it can be used as a tool in the project. I have during the week taken Git courses online, watch several youtube videos and been helped by team members. I feel that I’m far from done, hence I want to continue to learn and reach a greater understanding. Regarding scrum, we have been learning a lot in class and even tried it out during the lego-exercise. However, the implementation of scrum in the processes is a hard task and an unusual way of working for me. Due to this i also want to learn more by both theoretical knowledge but also by trying out the method in the group and evaluating it continuously.  By gaining knowledge of these basic concepts I aim to be able to contribute value to the project and the team since my focus can be on the actual task rather than the tools needed. 

**How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?** 

We started of the week by forming a group of different people from various educations. We have different knowledge in the areas that the course treats. This week has been a lot about me learning and unfortunately not me learning the rest of the team so much concrete stuff. However, I have helped the group forward by participating in setting up and coordinating different tools we’re using. Moreover, I believe that the discussions about our social contract and expectations have led to an important understanding of each other and the way we will be able to work together. I want the team to feel that we can largely exchange from each other and push our progress forward. In order for us to do that I think that it is important that we get to know one another better by spending time together to know how we can help each other and share our knowledge and experiences. 

**What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**

The project has yet to been started and so also the application of scrum. But we have prepared us by learning about the method and valuable tools. I have been a part of creating a plan for how scrum will be used in the project. By setting up easy access channels, daily scrum meetings and a task manager board. I want to be able to say that the team uses scrum as our method. I order for that to happen we have to make sure that we follow up on the plan and attend all the meetings and keep a continuous documentation the following weeks. I want to contribute with my time and knowledge as well as keeping track of the steps we have to take to make the process transparent. 

**What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).**

As mentioned above my learning objective this week is to learn how to use Git together with my team and co-create value as well as exploring the scrum methodology. I don’t want to be a weight for the rest of the group, the other way around; I want to be an asset who drives the group to deliver a great project. Learning about Git is not just about the program itself, but also how it works together with my computer and the terminal as well as other team members. The reason for choosing this goal is that it will facilitate the everyday work and hopefully in the end save the team a lot of time and troubles. Greater knowledge makes it possible to handle various situations that may occur along the way. I will get there with the help of my team, course literature and online tutorials but also by trying out and experiment with Git. I have own repositories made that I can play around with as a learning tool.
