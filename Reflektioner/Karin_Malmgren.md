**What do I want to learn or understand better?** 

In the beginning of this week I had never worked in Git or with the Scrum methodology. During the week, the subjects have been introduced in class and we’ve been discussing it in the project team. I want to learn about Git and how it can be used as a tool in the project. I have during the week taken Git courses online, watch several youtube videos and been helped by team members. I feel that I’m far from done, hence I want to continue to learn and reach a greater understanding. Regarding scrum, we have been learning a lot in class and even tried it out during the lego-exercise. However, the implementation of scrum in the processes is a hard task and an unusual way of working for me. Due to this i also want to learn more by both theoretical knowledge but also by trying out the method in the group and evaluating it continuously.  By gaining knowledge of these basic concepts I aim to be able to contribute value to the project and the team since my focus can be on the actual task rather than the tools needed. 

**How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?** 

We started of the week by forming a group of different people from various educations. We have different knowledge in the areas that the course treats. This week has been a lot about me learning and unfortunately not me learning the rest of the team so much concrete stuff. However, I have helped the group forward by participating in setting up and coordinating different tools we’re using. Moreover, I believe that the discussions about our social contract and expectations have led to an important understanding of each other and the way we will be able to work together. I want the team to feel that we can largely exchange from each other and push our progress forward. In order for us to do that I think that it is important that we get to know one another better by spending time together to know how we can help each other and share our knowledge and experiences. 

**What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**

The project has yet to been started and so also the application of scrum. But we have prepared us by learning about the method and valuable tools. I have been a part of creating a plan for how scrum will be used in the project. By setting up easy access channels, daily scrum meetings and a task manager board. I want to be able to say that the team uses scrum as our method. I order for that to happen we have to make sure that we follow up on the plan and attend all the meetings and keep a continuous documentation the following weeks. I want to contribute with my time and knowledge as well as keeping track of the steps we have to take to make the process transparent. 

**What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).**

As mentioned above my learning objective this week is to learn how to use Git together with my team and co-create value as well as exploring the scrum methodology. I don’t want to be a weight for the rest of the group, the other way around; I want to be an asset who drives the group to deliver a great project. Learning about Git is not just about the program itself, but also how it works together with my computer and the terminal as well as other team members. The reason for choosing this goal is that it will facilitate the everyday work and hopefully in the end save the team a lot of time and troubles. Greater knowledge makes it possible to handle various situations that may occur along the way. I will get there with the help of my team, course literature and online tutorials but also by trying out and experiment with Git. I have own repositories made that I can play around with as a learning tool.

## Vecka 2 

**What do I want to learn or understand better?**

It feels like I now have gained a lot of knowledge in both scrum practises and git, and I am ready for some more practical experience. This week we have started looking and trying out Android Studio, and I feel that my coding is rusty. We sat together in the team and did the instructions for android1 that was posted in GitHub, everyone was really helpful and it felt like a good start. I want to refresh my old knowledge in coding and also learn more about how to use Android Studio and how we can work with the program in the project. To do so I aim to watch tutorials and try out simple tasks to get some basic experience. I also believe that the team will be a great support and that we will be able to share knowledge among each other. 
 
**How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?**

During these past weeks, I have read a lot of interesting articles, watched tutorials and tasks on both the scrum process of working but also on how to use git. This new-found knowledge I want to share with the rest of the group; while working but also by recommending my favourites. While doing the android1 exercise and trying it out together we could all help each other with the different problems we encountered. In the application of scrum, we have learnt constantly during the week by getting real experience of the way of working. We are able to contribute to each other’s learning since it is new to us all. 
 
**What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?**

This past week I have acted as the team scrum master, it was very much a test week for us since all our knowledge was based on theory. Since the work with the application hasn't started yet I acted far from the way the scrum master has been described during lectures and in the literature. However, the group has learnt a lot and we have implemented daily scrums, sprint backlog and in the end of the (unusually short) sprint we did a sprint retrospective to evaluate how the past week worked out. It was hard to do a sprint review since we haven't started the work with the actual project. During the next sprint, I think that my contribution will be even larger since we can experience a broader spectrum in the application of scrum and also meet with the product owner.

Last week my ambition was set on learning more about scrum and git, and I feel like I really have! By tutorials, team members and course literature I have learned a lot. I have enjoyed the way of working and learning and for the next week my priority will be to learn more about Android Studio and Maritime IT. The reason for this is that we were presented to the task and the project as a whole and I didn't feel my knowledge in the area was sufficient. To be able to deliver good work I want to understand the product owner and the needs better. And in order to actually create the functionality I need to become familiar with the tools and more specifically with Android Studio. 
 
My plan for achieving this is to read the literature that is now available on the course GitHub site regarding Maritime IT and discuss it with the team. Meeting the product owner will also be a great way to sort out any ambiguities. Regarding Android Studio I think the best way for me is to do active learning by different tasks similar to the Android1 and use help on the web and in the team when I encounter new problems. While doing this I will be able to at the same time refresh my coding skills. 
 
This sprint consisted of 3 days because of Easter holiday.
